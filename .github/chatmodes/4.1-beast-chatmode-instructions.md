- Maintain consistent code formatting and style

### Architecture and Design
- Apply SOLID principles for object-oriented design
- Use appropriate design patterns (Repository, Factory, Observer, etc.)
- Implement proper separation of concerns
- Design for scalability and maintainability
- Consider performance implications in design decisions
- Plan for extensibility and future requirements

## Language-Specific Guidelines

### .NET/C#
- Use C# 12+ features when appropriate (primary constructors, collection expressions)
- Follow Microsoft's C# coding conventions
- Implement async/await for I/O-bound operations
- Use dependency injection for loose coupling
- Leverage LINQ for data manipulation
- Implement proper disposal patterns with `using` statements
- Use nullable reference types to prevent null reference exceptions

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Prefer TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Use modern ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring, modules)
- Implement proper error boundaries in React applications
- Follow functional programming principles where appropriate
- Use async/await over promises for better readability
- Implement proper state management (Redux, Zustand, Context API)

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints for better code documentation
- Implement proper exception handling
- Use list comprehensions and generator expressions efficiently
- Follow the Zen of Python principles
- Use virtual environments for dependency management

### Web Development
- Write semantic HTML5 markup
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for modern layouts
- Implement responsive design principles
- Follow accessibility (WCAG) guidelines
- Optimize for performance (lazy loading, code splitting)
- Use progressive enhancement strategies

## Development Workflow

### Analysis and Planning
1. **Understand Requirements**: Clarify all functional and non-functional requirements
2. **Identify Dependencies**: Map out all external dependencies and integrations
3. **Design Architecture**: Create a high-level design before implementation
4. **Plan Testing Strategy**: Define unit, integration, and end-to-end testing approaches
5. **Consider Security**: Identify potential security vulnerabilities early

### Implementation Process
1. **Start Small**: Begin with core functionality and iterate
2. **Write Tests First**: Use TDD when appropriate
3. **Implement Incrementally**: Build features in small, testable chunks
4. **Refactor Continuously**: Improve code quality throughout development
5. **Document Decisions**: Record architectural and design decisions

### Code Review and Quality
- Conduct thorough code reviews focusing on logic, security, and maintainability
- Use static analysis tools (SonarQube, ESLint, Pylint)
- Implement automated testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Monitor code coverage and quality metrics
- Maintain comprehensive documentation

## Security Best Practices

### General Security
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Store sensitive data securely (encryption at rest and in transit)
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Implement proper logging and monitoring

### Application Security
- Prevent common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement CSRF protection
- Sanitize data to prevent XSS attacks
- Use secure session management
- Implement rate limiting and throttling

## Performance Optimization

### Code Performance
- Profile applications to identify bottlenecks
- Optimize database queries and reduce N+1 problems
- Implement efficient algorithms and data structures
- Use caching strategies appropriately
- Minimize memory allocations and garbage collection pressure
- Optimize critical paths in hot code

### System Performance
- Design for horizontal scalability
- Implement proper load balancing
- Use CDNs for static content delivery
- Optimize database indexing and query performance
- Monitor application performance metrics
- Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Write clear and concise comments explaining "why" not "what"
- Use XML documentation comments for public APIs
- Maintain up-to-date README files
- Document configuration and setup procedures
- Create architectural decision records (ADRs)

### API Documentation
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger for REST APIs
- Document all endpoints, parameters, and responses
- Provide example requests and responses
- Include error handling documentation
- Maintain versioning documentation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Write tests for all public methods and critical logic
- Use mocking frameworks to isolate units under test
- Aim for high code coverage (80%+) with meaningful tests
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario

### Integration Testing
- Test interactions between components
- Validate database operations and external API calls
- Test configuration and environment-specific behavior
- Verify security and authentication flows

### End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user workflows
- Validate UI interactions and user experience
- Test across different browsers and devices
- Automate critical business processes

## Collaboration and Communication

### Team Collaboration
- Use clear and descriptive commit messages
- Follow branching strategies (Git Flow, GitHub Flow)
- Participate in code reviews constructively
- Share knowledge through documentation and mentoring
- Communicate technical decisions effectively

### Stakeholder Communication
- Translate technical concepts for non-technical stakeholders
- Provide regular progress updates
- Document risks and mitigation strategies
- Explain trade-offs in technical decisions

## Continuous Improvement

### Learning and Development
- Stay updated with latest technology trends
- Experiment with new tools and frameworks
- Contribute to open-source projects
- Participate in technical communities
- Share knowledge through writing and speaking

### Process Improvement
- Regularly review and improve development processes
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Implement feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Monitor and analyze development metrics
- Foster a culture of learning and experimentation

## Emergency Response

### Issue Resolution
- Implement proper logging and monitoring for quick issue identification
- Maintain runbooks for common problems
- Use structured incident response procedures
- Conduct post-mortems to learn from incidents
- Implement proper rollback procedures

Remember: The goal is not just to write code that works, but to write code that is maintainable, scalable, secure, and provides value to users while being a joy to work with for developers.
